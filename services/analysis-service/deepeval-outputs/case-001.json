We aimed to assess the effect of marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation on carotid plaques among patients with diabetes and whether the effect was modified by genetics.\nIn this 14\u00a0month double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 415 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) were randomly assigned to receive high-dose (3.0\u00a0g/day) or low-dose (1.5\u00a0g/day) marine n-3 fatty acids (fish oil) or placebo (refined olive oil). The primary outcome was the prevalence of carotid plaques. Secondary outcomes included changes in NMR-derived lipoprotein subclasses. Genetic interactions with the supplementation were also explored.\n383 participants (92.3%) completed the 14\u00a0month intervention, and 359 patients (86.5%) completed carotid ultrasound exams. Fish oil supplementation did not significantly reduce the carotid plaque prevalence (P trend\u2009=\u20090.111). Compared to the placebo, the odds ratios (95% CIs) of carotid plaque risk were 1.11 (0.56-2.22) and 0.54 (0.26-1.13) for low-dose and high-dose groups, respectively. Fish oil supplementation also showed no significant effect on the incidence of new carotid plaques (P for trend\u2009=\u20090.304) or the regression of existing plaques (P for trend\u2009=\u20090.390). High-dose intervention significantly reduced remnant cholesterol, LDL-1-triglycerides (TG), HDL-4-TG, and HDL-3-TG. In subgroups by genetic risk, the high-dose intervention significantly reduced carotid plaque risk specifically in patients with a low genetic risk for remnant cholesterol, with no significant benefit observed in those with medium or high genetic risk (P for interaction\u2009=\u20090.008; FDR\u2009=\u20090.056).\nIn patients with T2D, 14\u00a0month marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation does not reduce carotid plaque risk but improves lipoprotein profile. The anti-atherosclerotic effect appeared significant in patients with a low genetic risk of remnant cholesterol, warranting further investigation into personalized nutritional strategies.\nClinicaltrials.gov NCT03708887."

Incident AF and HF were modeled using clock-forward multistate Markov models for four transitions: baseline to AF, baseline to HF, AF to HF, and HF to AF. These transitions represent sequential disease progression, where either AF or HF may occur first and later progress to AF-HF comorbidity. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated per 1-SD increment. Joint exposure and mediation analyses were performed.\nOver a median 15.4 years, 10,084 developed AF and 3,117 H F; 1,335 transitioned from AF to HF and 426 from HF to AF.

When clinical features such as abdominal pain, lipemia retinalis, eruptive xanthomas, hepatosplenomegaly, pancreatitis or visibly lipemic plasma accompany the biochemical disturbance, the condition is called \"chylomicronemia syndrome\". Subtypes include rare monogenic familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), the more common multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome (MCS), autoimmune chylomicronemia and lipodystrophy-associated chylomicronemia. Patients are at risk for acute pancreatitis and sometimes atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Accurate diagnosis includes medical history, physical exam, laboratory testing (including plasma apolipoprotein B and the ratio of triglyceride to total cholesterol), clinical scoring systems, as well as selective use of genetic testing when FCS is suspected. In adults the overwhelming majority of patients with chylomicronemia have MCS and not FCS. Treatment centers on dietary fat restriction, total alcohol avoidance, management of secondary factors, and traditional triglyceride-lowering therapies such as fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids. Acute pancreatitis management requires stabilization, analgesia, supportive care and preventive management of hypertriglyceridemia. Emerging RNA-based therapies targeting apolipoprotein C-III (e.g., volanesorsen, olezarsen and plozasiran) offer transformative potential for FCS and for some refractory patients with other chylomicronemia subtypes. A multidisciplinary approach-integrating clinical, biochemical, and genetic assessment-guides therapy and reduces pancreatitis risk."

          "snippet": "Omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3s) are polyunsaturated fatty acids linked with numerous health benefits. Omega-3s exhibit multifaceted activities through various mechanisms. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) alleviates oxidative stress by lowering reactive oxygen species and improving oxidative stress in brain tissues and acts against neurodegenerative disorders. It has the potential to regulate cell membranes, decrease inflammation, improve endothelial activities, reduce triglycerides (TGs), weaken oxidative stress, and encourage cardiovascular, metabolic and immunological health. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) modulates mitochondrial activity, enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and facilitates fatty acid oxidation, which lowers lipid accumulation and helps energy metabolism and is effective in obesity. Omega-3s such as EPA, DHA and alpha-linolenic acid show anticancer activity, promote apoptosis, decrease the proliferation of cancer cell and enhance chemotherapy efficacy. Moreover, DHA has potential effects during pregnancy and fetal development. Omega-3s are often inadequate in our diet and play a significant therapeutic function in several disorders. They have been documented by global health specialists as essential constituents of the human diet. Their relevance depends on their ability to act as a nutritional intervention with significant uses in health promotion. Consequently, dietary nutrition is associated with disease prevention and enhanced clinical results. The growing demand for health-related products and innovations is expected to have an impact on developing dietary patterns. As a result, omega-3s are increasingly incorporated into functional foods and supplements. This analysis highlights omega-3s ability to improve health outcomes as well as prevent chronic diseases. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Dietary therapies like the DASH diet and omega-3 supplements show cardiometabolic advantages in Western populations. Few Asian cohort studies have examined the effects on obese people with dyslipidemia and hypertension.\nThe study aims to evaluate the associations of omega-3 supplementation and DASH diet adherence, individually and in combination on lipid profiles, blood pressure, and metabolic outcomes among Chinese obese adults.\nThis retrospective analysis examined data from 3,350 obese adults (BMI\u202f\u2265\u202f28\u202fkg/m2) with hyperlipidemia and hypertension, recruited at First Hospital of Qinhuangdao City from March 2023 to February 2025. Validated food frequency surveys and structured self-reports examined dietary adherence, while prescriptions and self-reports confirmed omega-3 consumption. LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were the main results. Weight loss, glycemic control, and lipid/blood pressure targets were secondary outcomes. Multivariable linear, logistic, and mixed-effects regression models were used for statistical analysis.\nAmong participants, 42.7% used omega-3 supplements, 35.2% adhered to the DASH diet, and 22.1% followed both interventions. Combined adherence was associated with the greatest improvements: LDL-C reduction (-31.7\u202fmg/dL), HDL-C increase (+5.8\u202fmg/dL), triglyceride reduction (-45.3\u202fmg/dL), and systolic/diastolic BP reduction (-14.7\u202fmmHg, all p <\u202f0.001). Participants with combined adherence were significantly more likely to achieve both lipid and BP targets (68.6%; OR\u202f=\u202f3.74, 95% CI: 3.20-4.40) than those with single interventions. Subgroup analyses revealed stronger benefits among older adults, women, individuals with longer obesity duration, and those with diabetes. Time-dependent analyses confirmed sustained improvements over 24\u202fmonths. Adverse events were generally mild, with overall adherence remaining above 80%.\nCombined omega-3 supplementation and DASH diet adherence was associated with synergistic improvements in lipid and blood pressure control, weight reduction, and glycemic outcomes. These findings support the implementation of integrated dietary and supplement-based strategies for cardiometabolic risk reduction in obese adults, particularly in Asian populations."

The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of EPA (1\u00a0g) and DHA (1\u00a0g) were analysed to understand their lipid-lowering mechanisms. The study also assessed the impact of omega-3 fatty acid-based formulation, (EPA 180\u00a0mg and DHA 120\u00a0mg), on lipid biomarkers in a simulated disease population. Over six months, the model predicted a 14.7% reduction in triglycerides, 1.7% reduction in total cholesterol, 3.7% increase in LDL, and a 22.38% increase in HDL. Non-traditional markers improved markedly, with triglyceride-to-HDL ratio reduced by 31%, total cholesterol-to-HDL by 21%, and LDL-to-HDL by 16%. A population-level subgroup analysis showed that individuals with high baseline lipid ratios (triglyceride-to-HDL\u2009>\u20098, total cholesterol-to-HDL\u2009>\u200912, LDL-to-HDL\u2009>\u20098) could achieve\u2009>\u200935% reductions within six months.

In this narrative review we analyzed and compared the primary sources of omega-3 fatty acids, including plant-derived alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), derived from flaxseed, chia, walnuts, and canola oil; and marine-derived eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), derived from microalgae, fish oil, and krill oil; with a focus on their bioavailability, clinical effects, and practical applications. The findings revealed that compared with marine-derived ALA, EPA and DHA, derived from plants, exhibited far superior bioavailability, which is associated with greater clinical efficacy, particularly in reducing triglycerides (average reductions of 15%-30% with doses of 2-4\u2009g/d), lowering inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, achieving significant cognitive improvements, and promoting muscular development and strength. Conversely, ALA demonstrated limited conversion to EPA and DHA, requiring higher doses (>20\u2009g/d) to achieve comparable benefits. Therefore, ALA is less recommended for consumption than EPA and DHA. In specific conditions, such as psychiatric disorders and cardiovascular diseases, formulations with higher EPA:DHA ratios (2:1 or greater) have proven more effective, particularly in alleviating depressive symptoms, with dosages of 1-2\u2009g/d of EPA. The findings of this review also highlighted the relevance of plant-based sources for vegetarian and vegan populations, leading to our proposal that microalgae supplements may be a sustainable and effective alternative. Practical implications underscore the importance of personalized supplementation strategies tailored to the clinical and dietary needs of individuals. However, significant gaps in the literature were identified, including the lack of direct comparisons between sources and the need for standardized dosing and evaluation methods to optimize observed benefits. In this review we have sought to effectively summarize current best practices and recommendations for omega-3 fatty acid supplementation to support general health and also to emphasize the necessity for future research to establish effective doses and scales of impact based on omega-3 fatty acid sources and clinical objectives, facilitating evidence-based nutritional and therapeutic interventions."

Marine-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), may improve MetS components through triglyceride-lowering, anti-inflammatory, and insulin-sensitizing effects; however, randomized controlled trial (RCT) results remain inconsistent, and the influence of dose and intervention duration is unclear.\nFollowing PRISMA guidelines, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched to June 2024 for RCTs in adults with MetS or its components. Eligible trials assessed marine-derived omega-3 supplementation (EPA/DHA) versus placebo or control and reported at least one MetS diagnostic criterion (triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, or waist circumference) or related parameter (LDL cholesterol, HOMA-IR, or HbA1c). Data were extracted in duplicate and quality assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool. Trials were categorized by dose-low (<1000 mg/day), medium (1000-2000 mg/day), and high (>2000 mg/day)-and duration: short-term (ST; \u22648 weeks), medium-term (MT; >8-12 weeks), and long-term (LT; >12 weeks). Meta-regression using ordinary least squares estimated dose-duration effects. Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and Egger's test for outcomes with \u22653 studies.\nTwenty-one RCTs (n \u2248 1950) were included. For triglycerides, the largest reductions occurred in the high-dose LT (-56.78 mg/dL \u00b1 3.44) and ST (-50.873 mg/dL \u00b1 3.04) groups, and MT duration (-41.536 mg/dL \u00b1 4.12), showing that in high doses of omega-3, the beneficial effect of reducing TGs was more prominent in long-term and short-term treatment other than with medium-term duration of treatment. In comparison, the result for medium-dose with MT duration was (-24.93 mg/dL \u00b1 0.464) and for LT duration was (-31.843 mg/dL \u00b1 0.46), all p < 0.001. In LDL cholesterol, an increase in the low-dose ST group (+7.04 mg/dL \u00b1 4, p < 0.001) and low-dose LT group (+35.525 mg/dL \u00b1 4.33, p < 0.001) was observed. In other subgroups, either there were no data available or the number of studies was limited and could not be considered as statistically significant in meta-analysis due to low power. As for HDL cholesterol, FBS, SBP, DBP, waist circumference, BMI, and HOMA-IR, the data extracted from the included studies were not sufficient to be eligible for the meta-analysis.\nMarine-derived omega-3 supplementation produces substantial triglyceride reductions, especially at doses >2000 mg/day for \u22658 weeks. HDL cholesterol and blood pressure benefits are not consistent, fasting glycemia is largely unaffected, and LDL cholesterol may increase, especially in low doses. High-dose marine omega-3s can be considered as part of dietary strategies for MetS management, with monitoring for LDL changes. Standardized intervention protocols and long-term RCTs are needed to clarify dose and duration-response relationships."

ApoC-III inhibits lipoprotein lipase and impairs clearance of both triglyceride-rich and cholesterol-rich lipoproteins. Novel therapies targeting APOC3 mRNA to reduce triglycerides, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), achieve greater triglyceride reductions than standard agents. Volanesorsen and olezarsen, both ASOs, are approved as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglycerides in familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) in different regions. Plozasiran, an siRNA, is in late-stage clinical development. Indirect cross-trial comparisons were performed, aligned by timepoint and outcome measures, and indicate comparable efficacy of olezarsen and plozasiran in patients with chylomicronemia. APOC3 inhibition is now an established therapeutic approach for reducing the risk of acute pancreatitis in FCS, with three agents, volanesorsen, olezarsen, and plozasiran, demonstrating efficacy. However, its role in ASCVD prevention remains unproven.

Furthermore, the dietary plan positively impacted overall body composition and morphometric parameters.\nThese preliminary findings suggest that a personalized, nutritionally targeted approach may be an effective non-pharmacological strategy for managing cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors during the menopausal transition and postmenopausal period. Further large-scale, controlled studies are warranted to confirm these results and explore long-term outcomes."

Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), often linked to obesity, are major global health issues driven by abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the blood. Omega-3 fatty acids, known to lower triglycerides and prevent CVD, and probiotics, which enhance gut microbiota balance and nutrient absorption, were evaluated for their combined effects. The experiment involved five groups of male C57BL/6J mice: a normal diet group, an HFD group, an HFD\u2009+\u2009probiotics group, an HFD\u2009+\u2009omega-3 group, and an HFD\u2009+\u2009combined probiotics and omega-3 group. Over six weeks, the combined treatment group showed significant reductions in body weight gain, a significant improvement in ALT levels (a key liver function biomarker), and enhanced anticoagulation markers, such as prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, compared to the HFD group. Gut microbiota analysis via 16S rRNA sequencing also revealed significant increases in microbial diversity in the combined treatment group. These findings suggest that co-administration of probiotics and omega-3 offers potential therapeutic benefits in reducing obesity-related metabolic dysfunctions by improving lipid metabolism, liver health, and blood circulation."

Recent research has also highlighted the importance of food elements, specifically functional lipids, to prevent and treat these disorders. Lipids, such as omega-3 fatty acids, conjugated linoleic acid, phytosterols, and medium-chain triglycerides, possess powerful bioactive attributes, including anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic, insulin-sensitizing, and cholesterol-lowering activities. Such lipids also enhance lipid metabolism and immunity. They have impressive capabilities to curb oxidative stress and control inflammatory signals. Consuming plant-based diets and diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids, phytosterols, and medium-chain fatty acids have been shown to reduce some chronic diseases. This brief review explains how modified lipids as functional ingredients modulate chronic disease pathogenesis, emphasizing their contribution to lipid signaling, inflammation control, and energy metabolism. The development, efficacy, and accessibility of lipid-functional foods to provide broad public health benefits will require collaborative work across research, industry, and policy."

Genetics, epidemiological studies and clinical trials have demonstrated a causal relationship between plasma triglycerides and ASCVD. In the bloodstream, TGs are mainly transported by lipoproteins such as VLDL and their remnants, the so-called TG-rich lipoproteins (TRL). A better understanding of the pathological consequences of elevated plasma TG levels is essential, especially in the context of addressing residual cardiovascular risk, when other major risk factors, in particular low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), are optimally controlled.\nThis consensus paper highlights the available evidence on the physiology, metabolism and association with atherosclerosis of TRL and their remnants. We update the current knowledge in a multidisciplinary approach and highlight targeted therapeutic approaches including: i) diet and lifestyle, ii) established treatments such as fibrates and omega-3 fatty acid supplements, iii) novel pharmacological strategies to lower serum TG levels to reduce residual cardiovascular risk in patients on maximal LDL-C-lowering treatment, and iv) new therapeutic options in patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia.\nManaging TRL plasma concentration with a comprehensive approach that includes lifestyle changes and targeted pharmacological strategies is a key clinical approach for addressing cardiovascular (residual) risk and improving patient outcomes, especially in individuals with well-controlled primary target lipid levels such as LDL-C. In case of severe TG elevation, an intensive TG-lowering approach is of paramount importance for reducing the risk of acute pancreatitis."

Although mild/moderate hypertriglyceridemia is a recognized vascular risk factor, only two studies, the Japan EPA Lipid Intervention (JELIS) and the Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT), using pure eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or icosapent ethyl (IPE), the stable ethyl ester of EPA, respectively, rather than a combination of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and EPA, have demonstrated a reduction in the rate of cardiovascular events. For this reason, it was deemed appropriate to examine the implications and applicability of the REDUCE-IT study in real-life settings. This analysis suggests a transversal therapeutic approach, based on both LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, for patients at very high cardiovascular risk to achieve an effective prevention. Furthermore, among patients in secondary prevention, treatment with IPE should focus on those with the highest vascular risk (recent acute coronary syndrome, post-infarction, angioplasty, and coronary bypass grafting)."

For example, adjusting for circulating DHA levels as a mediator, the association of the genotype with HDL-c substantially lessened for both minor genotypes reflecting >122% mediation of the association of FADS by DHA. Additionally, we found evidence that LDL-c is moderated, to some extent, by all fatty acid measures.\nThis analysis demonstrates that an individual's fatty acid profile can act as a mediator/suppressor or moderator of the association of the FADS genotype and various cardiovascular biomarkers.

The best evidence for dyslipidemia management is offered by the Mediterranean Diet, the Plant-Based Diet, the High-Fiber Diet and the Anti-inflammatory Diet, while the DASH Diet and the Ketogenic Diet have also been shown to target additional pathological features like hypertension and other comorbidities.

Therefore, a comprehensive meta-analysis is needed to gain a deeper understanding of the specific effects of n-3 PUFAs on patients with T2DM. To examine the effect of n-3 PUFAs on cardiovascular indices in T2DM using a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\nOnline databases including PUBMED, EMBASE and Cochrane libraries were searched up to December 2023. We assessed the overall weighted mean difference in cardiovascular indices between the group supplemented with n-3 PUFAs and the control group. The differences were compared uniformly using pre- and post-treatment differences.\nSupplementation with n-3PUFAs in patients diagnosed solely with T2DM significantly reduced low density lipoprotein (LDL) (weighted mean difference (WMD) = -3.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -6.52 to -1.32, p = 0.003 < 0.05), triglycerides (WMD = -23.94, 95% CI = -34.95 to -12.93, p = 0.000 < 0.05), cholesterol (WMD = -8.39, 95% CI = -12.06 to -4.72, p = 0.000 < 0.05), glycated hemoglobin (WMD = -0.25, 95% CI = -0.41 to -0.06, p = 0.003 < 0.05) and the Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) index (WMD = -0.55, 95% CI = -0.81 to -0.29, p = 0.000 < 0.05). All other differences in lipid indices, glycemic indices, inflammatory parameters and blood pressure were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Supplementation with n-3 PUFAs decreased high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration in patients with T2DM and coronary heart disease (CHD) (WMD = -3.92, 95% CI = -6.36 to -1.48, p = 0.002 < 0.05). There were no significant differences in LDL, triglycerides, cholesterol, and C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients with T2DM and CHD (p > 0.05).\nN-3 PUFAs improved lipid levels and long-term blood glucose levels in patients diagnosed solely with T2DM, but did not significantly improve blood pressure inflammatory markers. N-3 PUFAs showed no significant improvement in blood lipid and inflammatory indexes in patients with T2DM and CHD.\nCRD42024522262, https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42024522262."
